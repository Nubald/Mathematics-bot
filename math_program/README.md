## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math_program.git
   cd math_program
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program provides an interactive menu-driven interface where you can:
1. Choose the mathematical domain (Basic Math, Algebra, Calculus, or Statistics)
2. Select specific operations within each domain
3. Input your data
4. View the results

### Example Usage

#### Basic Mathematics
```python
# Using the BasicMath class directly
from basic_math import BasicMath

result = BasicMath.add(5, 3)  # Returns 8
result = BasicMath.power(2, 3)  # Returns 8
```

#### Algebra
```python
# Solving a quadratic equation
from algebra import Algebra

# Solve xÂ² + 2x + 1 = 0
roots = Algebra.solve_quadratic(1, 2, 1)  # Returns (-1, -1)
```

#### Calculus
```python
# Calculate derivative
from calculus import Calculus
import math

# Calculate derivative of sin(x) at x = 0
result = Calculus.derivative(math.sin, 0)  # Returns approximately 1.0
```

#### Statistics
```python
# Calculate descriptive statistics
from statistics import Statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
stats = Statistics.descriptive_stats(data)
```
